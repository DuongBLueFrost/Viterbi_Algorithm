# Viterbi_Algorithm
Implementation of Viterbi Algorithm

Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for obtaining the maximum a posteriori probability 
estimate of the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events, especially in the context of Markov information sources and hidden Markov models (HMM).

This project goal is to implement a module that uses Viterbi algo to do POS tagging (Part-of-speech tagging).
File sentences.txt is where you insert the test sentence which has words from sheet survey in POS.xlsx - where also has transition table and emission table in sheet trans and emiss.

Below is the paragragh which my team analized:
Every	Fall, two bats	will fly together. They can not be apart cause the little one can easily fall so the big one has to watch over him. Today, after the long flight, they take a break on their favorite tree. Suddenly	a	ball	strike	right 	at	the	branch	which	the	bats	are	resting	causing	it	to	break	apart. Fortunately	the	big	bat	successfully	catch	the	other	so	none	of	them	is	hurt. Turns	out	there	is	a	kid	playing	catch	nearby	and	accidentally	throw 	the	ball	at	them. The	boy	feels	sorry	so	he	wants	to	apologize	to	the	poor	bats	but	his	watch	is 	ringing	which	means	it	is	time	to	go	home. Sad	as	he	is	the	boy	bow	and	wave	his	hand	to	say	goodbye. The 	bats	are 	a	little	scared	but	they	still	wave	back	at	the	boy	and	they	continue	their	journey	to	a 	different	place.
